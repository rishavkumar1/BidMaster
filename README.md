Online Bidding System Features:

Vendors can come and put their products up for bidding for a given slot within a date and time duration.
The registered users can visit the page to check the different products (by category), which are up for bidding. They can choose and bid for a product of their choice. There will be a fixed list of categories to choose while creating an auction for a product.
Each product has a base price, and the bidding for that product can be done with a price which is higher or equal to this base price. A bidding for a lesser price should throw an error.
At the end of the slot duration for a given product, choose the winner and send a communication to them.
Vendors can provide multiple items in a single auction while creating an auction.
Vendors need to see the history of auction products they have created.
Bidders need to see the history of their bids.
